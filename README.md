This project performs binary semantic segmentation: the goal is to classify each image pixel as belonging to the foreground (object of interest) or the background.
The segmentation is done on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset which consists of images of cats and dogs, annotated with pixel-level labels for the pet regions.
For more details and results, please read the "Binary-Semantic-Segmentation.pdf" file.
